        <p>
          I’m a passionate software developer who started coding in 2022 and
          never looked back. With a certificate in general programming from
          Parkland College and ongoing training at Fullstack Academy, I focus on
          building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas
          into real-world tools. When I’m not coding, I enjoy hiking, gaming,
          and traveling to new places.
        </p>
