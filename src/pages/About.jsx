          <p>
            Hey there! I'm a passionate developer who loves building immersive,
            thoughtful websites â€” like the one you're exploring now. Whether
            it's creating magical environments with React or crafting clean,
            accessible interfaces, I thrive at the intersection of code and
            creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
            Node.js. In my downtime, you'll find me sketching ideas, gaming, or
            cuddled up with my cat next to a warm screen.
          </p>
